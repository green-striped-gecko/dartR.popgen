\title{Hypergeometric  probability for DNADot}
\usage{
utils.HyperGeometricP(parg, Narg, narg)
}
\arguments{
\item{parg}{allele freq being trialled (Ptry)}

\item{Narg}{Pop size being trialled (Ntry)}

\item{narg}{Total number of alleles: j <- round(2 * n * jj) where n is the 
sample size and JJ is the proportion of the subsample being trialled}
}
\value{
A vector of probabilities
}
\description{
This function is used internally to calculate the hypergeometric expectation 
needed for DNADot
