\title{Read output files produced by the program STRUCTURE}
\usage{
gl.read.structure(folder.path, x = NULL, verbose = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{folder.path}{Path to the folder containing STRUCTURE output files [required].}

\item{x}{Name of the genlight object to associate population information with
[default NULL].}

\item{verbose}{Verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2, progress log;
3, progress and results summary; 5, full report [default 2 or as specified using 
gl.set.verbosity].}
}
\value{
A list of class "structure.result" containing the processed results from
 each STRUCTURE output file, with names based on the file labels.
}
\description{
This function reads and processes files produced by the population genetics
program STRUCTURE (Pritchard et al., 2000). It renames the files based on the
K value found in each file and consolidates the data into a standardized format.
}
\details{
This function processes STRUCTURE output files by:
\itemize{
  \item Finding the K value (number of populations) in each file
  \item Renaming files based on their K value and replicate number
  \item Extracting Q-matrices and other relevant information
  \item Optionally associating the data with population information from a genlight object
}

STRUCTURE is a widely used software for inferring population structure from 
multilocus genotype data. This function helps to organize and consolidate the
output files for further analysis in R.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming structure output files are in the "structure_results" folder
str_results <- gl.read.structure("structure_results")

# With population information from a genlight object
str_results <- gl.read.structure("structure_results", testset.gl)
}
