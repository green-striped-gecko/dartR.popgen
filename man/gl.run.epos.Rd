\arguments{
\item{x}{dartR/genlight object}

\item{epos.path}{path to epos and other required programs (epos, epos2plot are always required and bootSfs in case a bootstrap and confidence estimate is required )}

\item{sfs}{if no sfs is provided function gl.sfs(x, minbinsize=1, singlepop=TRUE) is used to calculate the sfs that is provided to epos}

\item{minbinsize}{remove bins from the left of the sfs. if you run epos from a genlight object the sfs is calculated by the function (using gl.sfs) and as default minbinsize is set to 1 (the monomorphic loci of the sfs are removed). This parameter is ignored if sfs is provide via the sfs parameter (see below). Be aware even if you genlight object has more than one population the sfs is calculated with singlepop set to true (one sfs for all individuals) as epos does not work with multidimensional sfs)}

\item{folded}{if set to TRUE (default) a folded sfs (minor allele frequency sfs) is returned. If set to FALSE then an unfolded (derived allele frequency sfs) is returned. It is assumed that 0 is homozygote for the reference and 2 is homozygote for the derived allele. So you need to make sure your coding is correct. option -U in epos.}

\item{L}{length of sequences (including monomorphic and polymorphic sites). If the sfs is provided with minbinsize=1 (default) then L needs to be specified. 
option -l in epos}

\item{u}{mutation rate. If not provided the default value of epos is used (5e-9).
option -u in epos}

\item{boot}{if set to a value >0 the programm bootSfs is used to provide multiple
bootstrapped sfs, which allows to calculate confidence intervals of the historic Ne
sizes. Be aware the runtime can be extended. default:0 no bootstrapped simulations are
run, otherwise boot number of bootstraps are run (option -i in bootSfs)}

\item{upper}{upper quantile of the bootstrap (only used if boot>0). default 0.975.
(option -u in epos2plot)}

\item{lower}{lower quantile of the bootstrap (only used if boot>0). default 0.025.
(option -l in epos2plot)}

\item{method}{either "exhaustive" or "greedy". check the epos manual for details. If method="exhaustive" then the paramter depth is used. default: "greedy".}

\item{depth}{if method="exhaustive" then this parameter is used to set the search depth, default is 2. If method is set to greedy this is setting is ignored.}

\item{other.options}{additional options for epos (e.g -m, -x etc.)}

\item{cleanup}{if set to true intermediate tempfiles are deleted after the run}

\item{plot.display}{Specify if plot is to be produced [default TRUE].}

\item{plot.theme}{User specified theme [default theme_dartR()].}

\item{plot.dir}{Directory to save the plot RDS files [default as specified 
by the global working directory or tempdir()]}

\item{plot.file}{Filename (minus extension) for the RDS plot file [Required for plot save]}

\item{verbose}{Verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2,
progress log; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report
[default 2, unless specified using gl.set.verbosity].}
}
\value{
returns a table of the Ne over time and a ggplot using estimate of times
and Ne (see epos.doc)

\description{
This is an implementation/wrapper to run epos \url{https://github.com/EvolBioInf/epos}. It relies on a compiled version of epos, epos2plot and if a bootstrap output is required bootSfs. For more details on how to install these programs check \url{https://github.com/EvolBioInf/epos} and look out for the manual epos.pdf (in the doc folder of the repository \url{https://github.com/EvolBioInf/epos/blob/master/doc/epos.pdf}. The binaries need to be provided in a single folder and can be downloaded via the gl.install.binary function. There are compiled versions available and also the necessary dlls for windows need to be provided (Under Linux gls, blas need to be installed on your system). There is currently no binary for MacOS available.
